                Medicine is not just an occupation or a career but a profession. We at Asian Medical Institute strive to instill in our students an appreciation of the meaning of service, a love of learning that will stay with them throughout their professional lives and a sense of duty to their patients, their colleagues and their community. Asian Medical Instituteâ€™s program in medical education is designed to foster excellence in the future leaders of medicine. The focus of our educational program is not merely the transfer of information but the transformation of the learner in a culture providing that ingenious combination of support and challenge that leads to education. We have designed a program to provide a broad, rigorous and flexible foundation that will enable students to reach their highest potential of achievements.
